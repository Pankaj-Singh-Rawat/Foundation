Python has complex as data type but C++ and java does not 
when accessing a string or list using -ve indexing 0 is not the first negative index instead it's -1
tuple is always printed inside '()'
and also used inside tuple(("here"))
set is used inside set(["here"]) for strings and integers
and set("here") for accesing characters only
dictionary is created using d = {} -> these curly braces and is printed inside them also on output
we can actually delete a variable in python
